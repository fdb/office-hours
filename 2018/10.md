# October dates

## Instructions

Find a slot that says "unassigned" and seems suitable. Edit the file
to include your name and whatever details you care to give about your
problem -- if you can include a twitter handle or some other means of
contacting you, that'd be great, since sometimes I may have to cancel
last minute. Open a PR.

Note: in the PR, feel free to include alternative dates that would
work for you. In the event of a merge conflict, I may pick one of
those secondary dates.
